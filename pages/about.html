<section class="about">
  <p>
    I’m a computer science student and self-taught developer focused on building
    reliable, well-structured software with real-world value. I’m currently
    seeking junior or entry-level opportunities where I can contribute, learn,
    and grow as a full-stack developer or general software engineer. My
    experience spans full-stack web development and desktop applications, with a
    strong interest in backend logic, APIs, and problem-solving. I work
    primarily with Java, Python, SQL, C++, JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS, and I
    place a strong emphasis on clean code, maintainable structure, and clear
    system design. I approach development with discipline and consistency,
    valuing solid fundamentals over shortcuts. Whether I’m implementing backend
    functionality, structuring a UI, or solving algorithmic problems, I focus on
    writing code that is readable, scalable, and easy to reason about. Beyond
    technical skills, I value clear communication, attention to detail, and
    self-driven learning. I’m comfortable learning independently, asking the
    right questions, and collaborating to deliver quality results. I’m currently
    open to internships and actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills in
    a professional environment.
